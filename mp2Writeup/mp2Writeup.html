        <h3>Overview & Usage</h3>
        <p> For this project I used p5's web editor in order to create 6 different sketches
          that utilized the possiblities of what you can do with p5. See the gallery to find
          the links to all of the sketches: <a href="/gallery/gallery.html">Gallery</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        <p>
          <h5>Sketch 1</h5>
          For the first sketch since it needed to be static, but still have some complexity I 
          took what I did for the grid in my final project and adjusted it so that it drew
          rectangles instead of lines. 
          <h5>Sketch 2</h5>
          For sketch 2 the only requirement was that there needed to be some randomness so that
          every time the page is reloaded there is something different about the sketch. To do 
          this I first tried just doing the random piece by creating an array of random numbers
          to be the changing size. I did this at first, so that I could judge if it was changing 
          by having the numbers be very different(1, 100, 50), but once I saw it was I switched 
          it to just random(max size); so that their could be more variation. Once I did this I 
          added my shapes, set their colors, and had their size be determined by the random selection. 
          <h5>Sketch 3</h5>
          This sketch needed to have an infinite loop. I decided that I wanted to have growing circles
          that started out small and grew over time. To do this I first start with one circle in the center
          where I had the radius be a variable to had .1 added to everytime the function was called. I 
          then called that function in the draw function and it worked. I then changed the background to black,
          created an array of shades of purple called ranColor, and had the fill value be random(ranColor) 
          that was called before the growing cirlce function. Finally, to finish the sketch I decided to add 
          more circles to grow in the growing circle function that were like the first one execpt for 
          different x and y values.  
          <h5>Sketch 4</h5>
          For this sketch the focus was having change based on user input. Since I had created the drawing app
          for my final project I was pretty familiar with how to do this. I decided to create a function for 
          mouseDragged where if the mouse is pressed then it draws a circle where their mouse is with a 25 radius. 
          To add more user input I also have the color set to change based on mouseX and mouseY. Finally, I wanted
          this to look like mulitple circles, so I set stroke to white to make then stand out on the black background.  
          <h5>Sketch 5</h5>
          The requirement for this sketch was that it needs to output audio. When looking at examples one that stood out
          was the doorbell. I liked how it connected to something in the real world, and decided to do something similar 
          that would take the user interacting with it in order to play the sound. I decided I wanted to make windchimes 
          that when clicked play a windchime sound. To do this I first found my sound and loaded into a variable called sample. 
          From their I decided to create the windchime sketch using rectangles. Then I created a function for when the mouse 
          is clicked the windchime sample plays. 
          <h5>Sketch 6</h5>
          Finally, for the last sketch since I needed to create audio and have a visual change based on user input I decided 
          to take the sound from the windchime sketch and combine it with sketch 4. To do this I did the same audio setup I did 
          in sketch 5 and added the function from sketch 4. Since I was checking if the mouse was pressed in the mouseDragged
          function for sketch 4 I was able to put the sample.play() there to combine the two. When I ran the sketch I was able to
          see that it was trying to play the sound and the color was changing and drawing the circles based on where the mouse was. 
          The other change I I ended up making was the shape of the circle into a rectangle. I did this as I wanted to play around with the 
          shape and see what I liked more aesthically. It was during this sketch that I came up with the future plan to create a meditation 
          app, and think that this would be the sketch I would want to build off of, and aesthitics would be an important aspect for this and 
          thought why not explore now.

        <h3>Issue Deep-Dive</h3>
        <p> 
          I didn't really run into any issues, but one thing that was difficult was sketch 5. Having to create the sound
          when trying to work in the editor does not work well if you have your own sound you want to use. To get around 
          this I did everything how I thought it would work and then looked at the console to see if what I wanted to 
          happen would happen on the event I had set. In my case I wanted the sound to play when the mouse was pressed. Even
          though I could not have the sound I wanted to play I was able to see that when I ran the sketch and clicked it was 
          trying to play the sound, but it could not find it. This means if I were to put this into a place where it could access
          the audio then I would be confident that it would work. This was a case where I had to work around an issue and actually
          learned how to reverse debug in order to figure out if my code would work instead of normal debugging where I
          typically have to look for why is it broken.
