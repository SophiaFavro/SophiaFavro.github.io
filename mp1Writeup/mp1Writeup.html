        <h3>Overview & Usage</h3>
        <p>The extension I created is called the Study Buddy! It allows you to have a little pet icon pinned<br />
            where you can create a to-do list and recieve encouraging words from your buddy. <br />
            The best way to run this code is to unpack the file in the extensions menu of your browser and pin it so it shows in the taskbar. 
        </p>
        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        <p>I knew I wanted there to be a popup, so I used the "hello world" example and customized it for my project.<br /> 
            I did this by adding my own icon and adusting the styling, manifest, html, and JavaScript console log.<br />
            <img src="/images/customizedIconStage.jpeg" /> <br />
            After the popup was complete it was time to start working on the to-do list.

            <li>Publish the extension, so others can use it</li>
            <li>Look at adding stduy timer</li>
            <li>Add notifications to remind user to check list</li>
            <li>Use notifications to send encouraging words, not just when clicked on</li>
        </ul>
