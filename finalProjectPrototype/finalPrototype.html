        <h3>Overview & Usage</h3>
        <p>
            This is a paint app where you can paint by choosing a color from the color picker
            on the side and press the mouse. When you are done painting your picture, hit the 
            save button to download your picture.

        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        <p> 
            I first Ran npm init, added index.html, index.js, and added start script to create local server to run it.
            I then Created canvas and made it to be proportionate to the window size. 
            From there went to create the shape and color picker. For the shape picker 
            I created the shapes and decided that in order to have them choose the shape 
            they would hit a key. In order to do this I added the key to press in order to
            select the shape. Then for the color picker I originally planned to have set 
            colors to choose from, but I was able to find a color picker in the p5 documentation
            and decided to do that instead. Once I had added the color picker my project now looked like this.
            <br><img src="/images/finalPrototypePickersPic.jpg" alt="grey screen with black circle, square, rectangle, and instructions to press keys for respective shapes"><br>
            Now it was time to allow users to draw on the canvas. To do this I first played around 
            with mouse dragged and shapes as I had seen this in the p5 documentation. I created a 
            mouseDragged function that would fill with the color picker selected color and drew circles. 
            Once this worked and I was able to switch between colors and have it draw the circles it
            was time to have it draw a line instead. To do this I first tried changing the function 
            to be mousePressed and having the line be with mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY. This did
            not work, so I went back to mouseDragged and added in an if statement to check if mouse is
            pressed then draw the line I tried before. This worked and I was able to draw the lines, but
            it was not using the color picker color. At first I tried moving around the fill, but when 
            this did not work I tried just setting fill to a set color which also did not work. I went 
            back to the p5 documentation and was able to find that stroke is how you set the color of lines.
            I had misread before and though that this was how you set the thickness of the line, so I was
            glad I went back and checked. Once I added the stroke with the color picker color I was able 
            to draw continuous lines and change the color in between using the color picker. The final piece
            I needed to complete this prototype was to add a way for the user to save the canvas to their computer.
            Thanks to a tip from Hannah I knew that p5 could do this, so I went to the p5 documentation to
            see how to add this feature. I first created a save button and set its position below the future
            shapes and color picker. I then created a saveCanvas function that used save(“filename”); in order
            to save the canvas as image to the users computer. Then I added a statement for when the button is
            pressed by the mouse it uses the saveCanvas function. When I ran npm start to see if it worked nothing
            happened when I pushed the button. I used inspect to see what was happening when I pushed the button 
            and saw that I was getting a typeError. I was not sure what was causing this, so I looked at a p5 example
            where they had the function as saveImage instead of saveCanvas, so I decided to switch mine to see if it
            would fix the issue. Once I changed the function to saveImage the save button worked. I'm not sure why 
            this happened, but wonder if it is because I am trying to have the canvas save as an image and not another
            canvas, but plan to do some more digging. Once I had the save button working my prototype was complete and
            now looked like this:
            <br><img src="/images/finishedPrototypePic.jpg" alt="grey screen with black shapes, color picker, and save button."><br>
            Now I needed to bundle with rollup in order to get it ready to deploy. To do this I installed rollup,
            installed node-resolve plugin, installed the copy plugin, created a config file for rollup, added a 
            build script to the scripts in package.json, and ran build. From there I needed to get it ready to push
            to GitHub, so I added a git ignore file to ignore the files that contained what was already in my
            code(ie node_modules and dist) and pushed to GitHub. Finally, I needed to deploy my site. To do this 
            I installed gh-pages, added a deploy script to package.json scripts, and in the terminal put rpm run deploy.
            When I first went nothing was showing up and when I inspected I found some issues that led me to make some
            changes to my config file as I knew from the game design project that since I was using cdn for the
            packages I needed to add treeshake false. Finally, I went to the site and was able to see my site up and running.

        <h3>Issue Deep-Dive</h3>
        <p>
            I tried to add a rectangle and was unable to. At first I thought it was because I was in the setup
            function. This confused me as I had a circle in the setup function that was working. At first I thought
            it may be due to the fill and it was not filling the second shape, so I added another fill before the 
            second shape. When this didn't fix it I thought it may be due to it being a different shape, and tried
            adding another circle instead. Once I did this the second circle appeared. Now that I knew it could work
            I decided to look at the rectangle documentation and see if it wasn't working with the rectangle because
            I had not declared it correctly. When I did this I quickly realized that I had written “rectangle” and not 
            “rect” when I was trying to draw it. Once I tried again with “rect” the rectangle was showing up. It reminded
            me of how syntax errors can cause issues and take time to fix when not caught.

        <h3>Ideas and Future Work</h3>
        <p>Explained in project scope below </p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
        <p>
            After completing the prototype I was able to remove the set colors and do the color picker earlier.
            This means that I do not need to worry about adding it for the final and could add a different feature instead.
            Also, while exploring how to change the shapes when drawing I saw many intresting ways to add changes to the line
            while drawing, and it made me realize that I could focus more on changing the weight of the line or possibly doing 
            special effects when drawing with lines. The other change that I would like to make is having everything move/be 
            responsive with window change. I started out wanting to do this, but it was hard to deal with when just trying to 
            have everything work. Thus, I would like to try to make this a goal for the final project. The last change to scope 
            would be not doing the downloading steps. Orginally, I thought I was going to have to add another package to allow 
            users to download an image of the canvas as a pdf, but once save worked and worked quickly I realized that the 
            downloading steps would be useless. Instead, I would like to explore one of my possible stretch goals. My plan 
            is to explore the ones I included, but also want to be open to adding something else if I stumble upon something 
            more benefical/intresting and don't want to set what I'll add instead just yet. 
        </p>
        <h3>Time Management</h3>
        <p>
            I think that it took me about the time I expected it too, but I was surprised by where I got stuck.
            Some of the steps that I thought would be easier/allow me to create something functional where difficult
            and I was able to find the information for steps I planned for the final while looking to make the "easier"
            ones functional. It made me have to rethink my process, and slowed me down for some features but made me 
            progress for features for the final. I defiently think that I need to include more time for exploring/playing
            around for the final.
        </p>
        <h3>Implementation Plan</h3>
        <p>
            When looking at how to select shapes I originally thought that this would be easier
            than drawing lines and having it save. However, when looking at how to do this I wasn't
            able to find anything in the documentation where I could have it switch between shapes, but 
            quickly found a way to draw lines. Thus, I decided to switch to have the choosing shapes
            be for the final project and included the line drawing as the default in this one(the prototype).
            The other change came when looking at having set colors. When looking for the shape picker 
            I was able to find a color picker in the p5 documentation, and realized that I could add
            that now instead of taking the time to do the set colors only to replace it later. 
            In terms of additions, in my project scope I talk about how I plan to include making everything 
            move/responsive with different window sizes as I think it would be beneficial if someone wanted 
            to draw a smaller picture and still have access to the tools without having to resize the window.
            I also plan on including one of my stretch goals or something equivalent based on what I find when exploring
            as I was able to do some of the steps I thought would be more difficult during this process. Finally, 
            I would like to add a special effect for the line drawing as I saw many options when working on this part
            and think that I could include one of them.
