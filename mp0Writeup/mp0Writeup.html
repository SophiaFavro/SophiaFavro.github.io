        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>To begin this process I started by personalizing the templates by clearing out the intial code,<br />
           and then changed the files names to about me and cheatsheet.<br />
           The next step I did was style the homepage. From there I moved on to the "About Me" page where<br />
           I wrote out the bio in the html file and then styled the page. 
        </p>
        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p>I ran into issues when putting links on each page. All the links worked on the home page, 
          but when I went to put them on the other pages if I clicked on the link it would give me an error. 
          I figured out that it was due to having a "." in front of the url. 
        </p>
        <h3>CSS Transition</h3>
        <h3>Ideas and Future</h3>
        <p> thinking of creating a dropdown for MP Writeups on homepage to maintain organization
          <br />Or add images of final products as the links</p>
