        <h3>Overview & Usage</h3>
        <p>
            For the final project I created a drawing app where the user can draw lines, circles,
            squares, and rectangles. Along with this they can use a grid for guidelines, choose colors,
            erase, clear, and save their work.

        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        <p>I started by setting up local dev toolchain by installing npm, and added my html and js files from the prototype.
            I decided when I showed others my prototype that I wanted the shapes to be buttons instead of key presses as
            the instructions for the key strokes stayed on the canvas when it was saved and wanted it to only be the picture.
            I talk about getting the button for drawing with line working in the issue deep dive. I struggled at first, but
            once I got the line version working it was easy to do it for the other shapes as well. Here is what it looked like:
            <br><img src="/images/DrawingAppWithButtons.jpg" alt="grey screen with buttons labeled circle, square, rectangle, line, and save"><br>
            I then wanted to add a clear button and used p5 clear in a function, so when the button was pressed it would 
            clear the canvas. Next I created a slider using p5, thats value would determine the size of the lines/shapes.
            When I did this I needed to switch the position of the buttons and adjust the canvas. The reason being that 
            when the slider was used it would cause shapes/lines to be drawn on it, and I didn't want that to ruin any 
            of the users picture. Here is what it looked like once I made these changes: 
            <br><img src="/images/drawingAppButtonsMoved.jpg" alt="grey screen with blue flower and buttons on right white stripe"><br>
            Next I started looking at how to make the page/elements responsive to changes in window size, but when I looked
            at p5's window resize I saw that it does this by running draw. The problem with this is that my project works by 
            not doing anything in draw because if I were to then it would get rid of anything the user had created by redrawing
            the canvas. Thus, I decided to not include this as the apps setup is determined by the window width and height, and
            if a user wants a different size canvas I would rather they had to resize and reload then resize and lose their work.
            Since I was not including this I wanted to add more features to make the app more useful. To do this I decided to add
            an erase button. Originally I planned on using p5's erase, but when I looked through the reference documentation I
            didn't think it would work how I wanted it to. However, I came across an example where the person made it seem like 
            it was erasing by drawing a line where the stroke was the background color. I decided to do this as well as it would 
            fit in nicely with how I had the other buttons set up and just created the button so that when its pressed the currentShape
            would be "erase" and it would work like the line, but the color would be the background color. This allows the user to
            still use the size slider to change the size of the eraser, and it appears as if it is erasing. Due to the work I was 
            able to accomplish in my prototype I decided to next pursue a stretch goal: I wanted to show and hide a grid that users
            could use to help them while drawing. - I first started exploring how I could hide and show something in p5. Found how
            someone did it with a button, and since I was already using buttons I decided to try it that way. I first created a button
            to show the grid, then a function that created a grid on the canvas, and a function that would show the grid when the
            button was pressed. Once I was able to show it I now needed to add a way to remove it. I added a remove grid button and 
            created a remove grid function. At first I thought about using hide, but when playing around with using it, it wasn't working.
            I then thought about using erase here and tried that out by having it erase, then do the grid shape, and go to no erase. This
            worked by following the shape of the grid to erase over it. Here is what the grid looked like: 
            <br><img src="/images/finalProjectWithGrid.jpg" alt="black line grid on grey background with buttons on right side white stripe"><br>
            The final piece on my implementation plan was to add a special effect to the line, but since I was able to have the shapes be
            stamped on or used to draw lines I decided against adding anything else as it could compromise the functionality of the others
            or would require putting code in the draw function which would wipe away all the other work a user had done. Thus, I decided
            to adjust some of the spacing to make it look nicer and got ready to deploy it. I followed the process I did for the prototype
            by using rollup to bundle my work, installed gh pages, and added the neccessary scripts to build and deploy my site. Once it was 
            ready I ran npm run deploy in the terminal and my site was live. Here is a picture of the final deployed project:

        <h3>Issue Deep-Dive</h3>
        <p> When I decided to use buttons to draw with the lines and shapes I ran into an issue trying to get the line to happen
            when the line button was pressed and only when it was pressed. I first tried to take what I had in the mouse dragged 
            function and put it into its own function and then tried to have it call a draw line function when in mouse dragged. 
            Neither of these worked and I was getting frustrated with the line, so I took a break from the line to try the other
            shapes. However, I struggled when doing this as the line was getting in the way and I couldn't tell why it was only 
            working when and where the button was pressed for the shapes. I commented out the line code, and found that instead of
            drawing the shape when the button was pressed I needed them to know to draw with the shape when the button is pressed.
            Thus, I created a currentShape variable that would change when each button was pressed. This way I could have the functions
            for when the buttons were pressed be about knowing what shape was wanted instead of drawing the shape. I used the currentShape
            variable to change to the shape of the button that was pushed and then tried to use that to have the shape drawn in the mouseDragged
            function. Even after doing this it was still not working correctly and I was not sure why. I had gotten so caught up in the fact 
            that I could do the currentShape for all the shape buttons that I was trying to make them all functional at once. Since I was 
            struggling to get the results I wanted with all of them I decided to take a step back and focus on only the line again as I had 
            already made that functional in the prototype. I knew that it worked and could better identify what may be causing it not to work 
            now that it was reliant on the currentShape variable. I tried to do an if statement within the mouseIsPressed if statement to see
            if the currentShape was "line", but that didn't work so I then did an && statement where it checked if the currentShape was line and 
            if mouseIsPressed. This worked and I was able to have it only draw a line when the button was pressed. When reflecting on why this was 
            an issue I saw that I was getting too ahead of myself and not slowing down. I had so much going on with the other shapes and was 
            moving, deleting, and trying different things for each that it was hard to follow what I had/hadn't done. When I slowed down and 
            just focused on one I was able to figure it out fairly quickly.
