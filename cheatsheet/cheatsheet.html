        <h3>Transitions</h3>
        <p>
          key idea: whatever is having the transition done to it would have this in its style sheet
          <ul id="transitionSteps">
            <li>transition-property: "whatever property you want to change";</li>
            <li>transition-duration: "how long you want change to take";</li>
            <li>transition-delay: "how long before change starts";</li>
          </ul>
          Then you just add another instance of whatever is having the transition with the action
          you want to start it. Below is a sample image. <br />
          <img src="/images/transistionExample.jpeg" />
