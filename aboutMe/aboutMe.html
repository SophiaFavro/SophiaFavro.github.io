        <p>Hello, I am Sophia and I am currently a student at the University of Washington majoring 
          in Human Centered Design and Engineering with a focus in Human Computer Interaction. <br /> 
          I chose HCI because it focuses on the relationship between the user and technology not just the 
          technology. 
          I am passionate about access to technology and using technology to improve people's lives. <br />
