        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>To begin this process I started by personalizing the templates by clearing out the intial code,
           and then changed the files names to about me and cheatsheet.
           The next step I did was style the homepage, below is an image that shows what the page intially looked like. 
           From there I moved on to the "About Me" page where I wrote out the bio in the html file and then styled the page.
           Next I planned to work on the CSS transition, so I did some basic styling on the cheatsheet and created a CSS section 
           to add to once I completed the transition. I then added the transition styling to the homepage css, and added what I did
           to the cheatsheet as well as here in CSS transition portion of the writeup. Finally, I went through everything to see what
           small adjustments to styling I wanted to make(like adding space between the links) and double checked that all the assignment
           requirements were completed. 
        </p>

        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p>I ran into issues when putting links on each page. All the links worked on the home page, 
          but when I went to put them on the other pages if I clicked on the link it would give me an error. 
          I figured out that it was due to having a "." in front of the url. 
          I also ran into an issue when trying to adjust the spacing between the links. I tried putting them
          in a div with a clss name, but it still wasn't working. I finally tried to style the a tag itself
          and it worked right away. I plan to look into this more to see why this is. 
        </p>
        <h3>CSS Transition</h3>
        <p>In order to create my CSS transition I knew I wanted to change the title on my homepage's color
          and size. I chose this because that page has the least going on and thought it would add a little
          suprise without distracting from the content on the page. I had already styled the title a little
          before adding the transistion, so I knew that I just needed to had the transistion-property, 
          transition-duration, and transition-delay. I first put in a bright color, made the delay short,
          and had the duration longer so that I could see if it was working correctly. Once I saw that it worked
          I adjusted this to match the aesthetic I wanted. I also decided that I wanted to change the font size,
          and for that I just added another transistion-property set to font size. The other key piece to this
          was having another h1{} in the stylesheet, but now I had h1:hover{} as I wanted the transistion to happen
          when someone hovers on the title.

        <h3>Ideas and Future</h3>
        <ul class="ideas">
          <li>I'm thinking of creating a dropdown for MP Writeups on homepage to maintain organization</li>
          <li>Adding images of final products as the links to pages and MP Writeups</li>
          <li>Changing the links to buttons that have transistion when hovered over</li>
        </ul>
