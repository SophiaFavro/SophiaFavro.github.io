        <h3>Overview & Usage</h3>
        <p>The extension I created is called the Study Buddy! It allows you to have a little pet icon pinned<br />
            where you can create a to-do list and recieve encouraging words from your buddy. <br />
            The best way to run this code is to unpack the file in the extensions menu of your browser and pin it so it shows in the taskbar. 
        </p>
        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        <p>I knew I wanted there to be a popup, so I used the "hello world" example and customized it for my project.<br /> 
            I did this by adding my own icon and adusting the styling, manifest, html, and JavaScript console log.<br />
            <img src="/images/customizedIconStage.jpeg" /> <br />
            After the popup was complete it was time to start working on the to-do list. I started out by creating a button to add tasks to the list. <br />
            As well as creating an input for the user to be able to type in their task. <br />
            <img src="/images/toDoListButton.jpeg" /> <br />
            I then needed to create an event handler that would be able to listen for when the "add task" button was clicked in order to take the input, <br />
            and add it to the list in the popup. To do this it was time to start working in my js file. I started by creating variables for the button, user input, and list. <br />

        </p>
        <h3>Issue Deep-Dive</h3>
        <p>Once I had added the button for adding a task and input I ran into an issue having the items added to the list and visible in the popup. <br />
            I was able to type in a task and click the "add task" button, but it would just dissapear instead of being added below. To go about fixing this
            I decided to add "console.log" within my event hadler for clicking on the button that would log the input(what was typed in by user).<br />
            <img src="/images/MP1IssueConsoleLog.jpg" /> <br />
            As you can see the console was logging it, so I knew that my event handler was working. I thought maybe the length had something to do with why it wasn't appearing, <br />
            but when I tried just "add" it still wasn't appearing. Due to this I decided to look and see if there was an issue in my html or css files instead of my js file. <br />
            I looked line by line to make sure that everything was matching and there were no syntax issues. While doing this in the html I saw my empty list ("ul") tags and thought 
            the list is empty and it should be adding the list item. In this moment I realized that I may have appended the listButton and listText to the listItem, but had not appended
            the listItem to my list. Meaning that my main parent node for the to-do list had no children, but the child was still being made. Everything was working and logging and the
            issue was that they just needed to be connected.
        </p>
        <h3>Ideas and Future Work</h3>
        <ul class="ideas">
            <li>Illustrate icon and add icon choices</li>
            <li>Publish the extension, so others can use it</li>
            <li>Look at adding stduy timer</li>
            <li>Add notifications to remind user to check list</li>
            <li>Use notifications to send encouraging words, not just when clicked on</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Kudos</h3>
        <ul class="ideas">
            <li>mdn web document on manipulating documents was very helpful for figuring out how to do the to-do list. I was able to read
              the document then try the shopping list example to test my understanding.
