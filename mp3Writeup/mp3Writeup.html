        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        <p>
            I first started by setting npm and adding my index html and js files. <br>
            From there I added the start script and ran the neccessary commands to create a web dev sever, <br>
            so that I would be able to test my game as I worked on it. Once I had all of this I added I then <br>
            added the neccessary packages. I needed P5.play and P5, so I linked to the cdn in the html as there were issues <br>
            with trying to use npm install in order to add them. From there I decided to start off by creating my game background. <br>
            To do this I first created the canvas in the setup function and used the draw function to set the background to green for grass. <br>
            I then created the roads by using a forloop to create the rectangles and space them out evenly across the window and set the color to grey. <br>
            Below is a picture of the finished background. <br>
            <img src="/images/gameBackground.jpg" /> <br>

            Now that the background was complete it was time to create the sprite that would be used to get across all the roads. 
        </p>
        <h3>Issue Deep-Dive</h3>
        <p>
            An issue I ran into when working on this project arose when I went to add the spirit. The spirit is a sprite that requires creating a function to set it up. <br>
            I created a function to make the spirit and to set how it moves when the arrows are pressed. I then called these functions respectively in the setup and draw functions. <br>
            Once I did this and ran the dev server to see if it worked, I was met with a white screen. I was not sure what was broken at first and started to debug. There were no errors, so 
            I first started by commenting out the calls for the spirit functions to make sure that my background was working. When I did so the background was back and working correctly.<br>
            From there I thought that there might be something wrong with spirit functions, so I checked what would happen if I commented at one function and tried running it with only one function called.<br>
            When I commented out the spirit setup function the background still showed up, so I knew that there wasn't an error happening that VSCode wasn't catching when it ran. Once I commented out the 
            the function for movement and kept the spirit setup. When I ran it this time I was met with the original error of a white screen. I now started commenting out individual lines in this function to see <br>
            if there was a problem in the function that was causing the error. During this process I kept getting met with the error, so I thought it might have to do with the libaries not being imported correctly. 
            I started looking at my html and double checked that everything was correct in that file. It was so I just started looking through everything. I was then able to find when I hovered over the new Sprite 
            line in the spirit setup function a popup appeared that said it did not recongize the command. I did not know how I missed this and realized that this was causing the issue.

        <h3>Ideas and Future Work</h3>
        <ul class="ideas">
            <li>Add music</li>
            <li>Add more designs to background, like trees, bushes, flowers, etc</li>
            <li>Personalize the icons with my own images</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Kudos</h3>
        <ul class="ideas">
            <li>The P5 documentation was very helpful for playing and testing ideas</li>
            <li>Hannah's game example was useful for looking to see if there were any pieces missing 
                from my html file when working on my issue
